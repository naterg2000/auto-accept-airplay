# auto-accept-airplay
This AppleScript can detect AirPlay notifications and click the Accept button so you don't have to. 

You can customize this script to work with other Mac notifications! You will just have to:

1. change `notificationPhrase` to some text that is in the notification you'd like to interact with
2. configure the UI Element path in the `try` statement to your notification's UI groups
